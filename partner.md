# PA5 Partner Agreement

By filling out this agreement, both partners agree to abide by the honor code (see syllabus) and to work together on this project.

Both partners will, to the best of their ability, support the other person in this PA as well as committing to do their own fair share of the work.

Both partners agree that any issues that occur that they cannot resolve between themselves will be brought up to their professor in a timely manner so that they can assist.

Both partners understand that their best way to get help from their professor if they get stuck is to go to office hours.

The lead programmer is the main person responsible for a given function. However, the function should still be written either with pair programming, or with the other partner helping and answering questions. 
The lead programmer should be the one to drive that function, and make major decisions about how to program it, which includes doing all typing. The navigator should not dictate every line of code to the lead programmer. There are no exceptions to this rule.

Both partners agree to take the lead on their assigned functions, AND to help their partner on the other functions. Both partners understand that under no circumstances should they take lead on their partners' functions, and that their grade will be primarily based on the functions they are lead on. Each partner also agrees to assist their partner in figuring out how to solve their functions; e.g., don't just do your part and leave your partner hanging.

## Plan for meeting: 
What days/times do you commit to meeting to work on and discuss this assignment? You should have planned meeting times throughout the project. Meetings can be in person or over Zoom. Put it in your calendar and don't cancel on your partner. Your meetings should not all be in the last day or two before the deadline.



## Lead programmer: For every task you need to solve in your program (likely each is a function), list the person who is the lead programmer.
* The calculation functions MUST be split evenly among the programmers. 
* Then the remaining functions should be split evenly as well. 
* Don't forget to think about any error checking functions you might need. 
* Both partners should be responsible for working together on main.
* Note that it is expected that you pair program to get the file reading part due by the design deadline working. 
* The functions that you are required to write for your design submission should be pair programmed and do not count toward lead programmer dividing up of tasks.

List each function purpose and the lead for that function here (must match functions in design document -- note that design document has more info than just the purpose of the function):
