# Children and Family Health PA5

## Problem
In order to better understand Baltimore neighborhoods, this data set tracks information about
children and family health. 

## Details
You must create a program that can read in all data from the file, store it in a list, and then answer questions about that data.

### File Info
The file has values comma-delimited. A description of the fields is below.

### Program Abilities
Your program must answer the following questions for the user:
* What has been the change in Teen Birth Rate from 2010 to 2014? Is it significantly down, down, flat, up, or significantly up. You should consider a change of +/- 5 per 1000 to be no change. Changes for +/- 25 are significant. This information should be output for each neighborhood to a file that the user chooses.
* Create a graph that shows the number of neighborhoods with low, moderate, and high density of fast
food outlets per 1,000 residents in 2013. Low density is less than 1 and high density is greater than 4.
* Is infant mortality related to prenatal care? The IMR-prenatal column categorizes neighborhoods based on the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the percent of births where the mother received early prenatal care. Determine in which category most Baltimore neighborhoods fall.
* A question of your choosing!

You must give a menu with all options for the user. The program should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.
