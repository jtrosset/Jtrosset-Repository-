# Baltimore City Salaries PA6

## Problem
In order to better understand Baltimore government, we can analyze the salaries of the Baltimore city employees.

## Details
You must create a program that can read in all data from the file, store it in a list, and then answer questions about that data.

### File Info
The file has values semi-colon-delimited. A description of the fields is below.

### Program Abilities
Your program must answer the following questions for the user:
* How many people make more, significantly more, less, or significantly less than the average salary for a Baltimore employee? You should consider a change of at least +/- 10,000 to be more/less, and a change of at least +/- 30,000 to be significantly more/less.
* Create a graph to show how many employees were hired each year.
* What is the average salary for each job?
* A question of your choosing!

You must give a menu with all options for the user. The program should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.
