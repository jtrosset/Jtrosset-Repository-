# Sustainability  PA5

## Problem
In order to better understand Baltimore neighborhoods, this data set tracks information about sustainability. 

## Details
You must create a program that can read in all data from the file, store it in a list, and then answer questions about that data.

### File Info
The file has values comma-delimited. A description of the fields is below.

### Program Abilities
Your program must answer the following questions for the user:
* What has been the change in each neighborhood for Number of Community Managed Open Spaces from 2010 to 2014? Is it extremely down (at least 75% down), significantly down (at least 50% down), down (at least 10% down), flat (between -10% and 10%), or up (at least 10% up). This information should be output for each neighborhood to a file that the user chooses.

* Create a graph that shows the number of neighborhoods with low, moderate, and high voter participation in the 2014 elections. A 35% or less voter turnout in considered low and a 45% voter turnout is considered high.

* Is carpooling to go to work related to a commute of 45 minutes or more? The CARPOOLING-SOCIAL column categorizes neighborhoods based on the percentage of people who car pool and those whose job is 45 minutes or more away from home. Determine in which category most Baltimore neighborhoods fall.

* A question of your choosing!

You must give a menu with all options for the user. The program should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.
