# Tweets PA5

## Problem
In this assignment you will analyze a dataset of real tweets that have been tagged with emotions.

## Details
You must create a program that can read in all data from the file, store it in a list, and then answer questions about that data.

### File Info
The file has values asterisk (`*`) delimited. The file is almost 1MB in size, so it may take a little while to read in the data from the file into your program; that's normal.

The fields appear in your file in this order on each row:

* The ID of the tweet. Each tweet has a unique ID number.
* The emotion of the tweet. The emotion was already determined for you using an AI program.
* The tweet itself

### Program Abilities
Your program must answer the following questions for the user:
* Write to a file all of the tweets of a specific emotion that have a specific word in it. The user chooses the word and the emotion. The file should have one tweet per line.
* Create a graph to show how many tweets have each emotion
* What is the average length of tweets by emotion? Which emotion has the longest tweets, and which has the shortest?
* A question of your choosing!

You must give a menu with all options for the user. The program should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.
