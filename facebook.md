# Facebook PA5

## Problem
It's time to analyze data about users of Facebook!

## Details
You must create a program that can read in all data from the file, store it in a list, and then answer questions about that data.

### File Info
The file has values semi-colon-delimited. A description of the fields is below.

### Program Abilities
Your program must answer the following questions for the user:
* What is the difference between number of likes and number of shares for each post? This information should be output for each post to a file that the user chooses. Is it significantly more likes, more likes, the same, more shares, or significantly more shares? You should consider a change of +/- 25 to be no change. Changes for +/- 100 are significant. 
* Create a graph that shows the number of posts with low, moderate, and high numbers of engaged users. A low number is less than 100 and a high number is greater than 400.
* A Facebook page can post many different types of updates. But which type gets the most likes? Determine which type has the highest number of likes on average.
* A question of your choosing!


You must give a menu with all options for the user. The program should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.
